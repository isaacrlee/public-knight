Starting with the minimum essentials, ALAS has established loyal relationships with most major  hospitals, medical facilities, Latino organizations and businesses throughout  the Chicago land area, all of which have provided support for the efforts of ALAS to help uninsured and underserved Latina women and their families.\\n\\nALAS differentiates itself from other breast cancer organizations by offering face-to-face tangible services in every phase of the breast cancer process, from diagnosis to survivorship.    In addition to providing emotional counseling through support groups, health education and breast cancer screenings, ALAS works with the community to provide bras, wigs and prostheses; arranges for free transportation to hospitals for mammograms and other diagnostic services, and provides mentoring about the complex medical processes involved with cancer treatment.  The goal of ALAS is to enable Hispanic/Latina women to receive the very best care and encouragement possible so they can move beyond cancer and begin living fulfilled and happy lives again.\\n\\nEducation is key to preventing the rising number of breast cancer patients in this growing demographic. ALAS has the desire, passion and knowledge required to accomplish this goal.","postal_code":"60613-8328","avatar_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/3/e/e/3ee394e9-875d-4ee5-b805-21af7697a117/7d064316-6a72-4394-a4cc-9854360ec7e7/10675789_694752890606398_5854749950209925832_n.jpg_sz","header_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/3/e/e/3ee394e9-875d-4ee5-b805-21af7697a117/fa796f88-c484-4ff0-b2f3-3f03f261b66d/575140_295368527211505_78218983_n.jpg_sz"},

To foster leadership qualities that the students will bring to their communities and make positive changes.\\n\\nOur Mission:\\nCabrini Connections helps economically disadvantaged students succeed in high school & move on to college or a career. We do this by pairing the students with an adult tutor who supports their academic achievement and provides guidance in life skills.\\n\\nHistory:\\nThe tutoring program was created in 1992 to support students from the Montgomery Ward Cabrini-Green Tutoring Program. The founders were volunteers with that program that saw the need to continue to help those students after the sixth grade. Cabrini Connections started offering one-on-one tutoring to 7-12 grade students in donated space in the Montgomery Ward headquarters building.\\n\\nSince 1992, more than 625 students have attended the program for at least one year along with over 800 volunteer tutor/mentors. Over 90% of 12th grade program graduates have entered college.","postal_code":"60661","avatar_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/8/8/5/885a4daf-7a91-43df-bcdb-94da80b0e8b0/6c242e79-5a02-4dba-9c7a-a56f5abb2a2d/cabrini_logo7.PNG_sz","header_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/8/8/5/885a4daf-7a91-43df-bcdb-94da80b0e8b0/3153ebaa-a2ff-4e3e-91e3-6c2505452512/save-the-date-sparkle-blue.jpg_sz"},

Our organization leads strategic campaigns, community outreach, and public policy initiatives that target the lack of affordable housing in metropolitan Chicago and across Illinois.\\n\\nIn addition, CCH presses for access to jobs, training, and public schools. Our community organizers, policy specialists, and public interest attorneys advocate with people hurt by homelessness, including mothers with children, unaccompanied youth, ex-offenders, prostitution survivors, and low-wage workers.\\n\\nTo preserve our independent voice, CCH does not accept government funding. Instead, we advocate for funds to create housing and improve services and opportunities for people who are homeless or at-risk, and to support the programs that serve homeless families, youths and adults.","postal_code":"60601-5963","avatar_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/d/d/9/dd91f66b-fe7c-4377-af31-e1d86ee5de81/effabefd-d017-4e27-b911-26c2c29c3f71/Logo-in-White-Box.jpeg_sz","header_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/d/d/9/dd91f66b-fe7c-4377-af31-e1d86ee5de81/b350a611-b19b-4b4b-a6d8-60bab01902b1/DSC_0156.jpg_sz"},

CFE is a volunteer driven organization that provides financial incentives, facilitates collaborative networks, and offers leadership opportunities to foster teacher quality throughout every stage of an educator’s career.\\n\\nThe Chicago Foundation for Education (CFE) was established by Joyce Rumsfeld and other community leaders to assist with implementation of character education curriculum in Chicago’s public elementary schools. CFE built upon this initial success by launching several other initiatives in support of teachers and students. Today CFE facilitates four grant‐based programs (Small Grants; Study Group Grants, including Coach and Team Member options; Fund for Teachers Fellowships, offered in partnership with the national Fund for Teachers organization; and the Action Research Leadership Institute) and an annual Teachers as Leaders and Learners Workshop. Grants are awarded directly to teachers and include opportunities for additional funding when the subject project or professional development includes a social emotional learning component, the evolution of CFE's early character education focus. \\n\\nCFE has directly impacted more than 1.1 million Chicago Public School students through investments of $9 million in more than 31,000 classrooms over its 29 year history. With assistance from several hundred dedicated volunteers during the 2014-2015 school year, 48,769 students benefited from their teachers’ involvement in CFE programs.","postal_code":"60602-3937","avatar_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/4/6/6/4661d644-cf81-477d-a510-2491639720b7/bad3da17-12e7-4b97-8717-370e354a5895/CFElogo-bestv2.jpg","header_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/7/b/d/7bdbbe74-1ba7-410e-9de3-0cb7e81a53bb/bd2ecd75-d360-41ab-b4b6-9c9e82ba3cc0/chifoundation.jpg_sz"},

A group of concerned community members worked with the administration of Saint Anthony Hospital, a community hospital on Chicago’s Southwest Side, to create Esperanza as a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) “Look-Alike.”\\n\\nSaint Anthony Hospital staff was concerned that many local residents used its emergency room for primary care services. This use pattern stressed the hospital’s finances; more importantly, it perpetuated a system of “unhealthy” healthcare in the community.\\n\\nFamilies who used only the emergency room—including for routine ailments—never developed the kind of ongoing relationship with a physician that has been shown to lead to good health outcomes. Hospital staff also realized they could not provide needed services such as social work, mental health, prescription drug assistance, and benefits counseling in the urgent care setting.\\n\\nEsperanza (which means HOPE in Spanish) was the response. The founders saw our health center as offering:\\n\\nHope to community residents who would be served regardless of income or insurance status\\n \\nHope that the community as a whole could live up to its full potential though optimum health and wellness\\n \\nHope that these needs could be met in a patient-centered, culturally sensitive atmosphere\\nOur primary service area now includes: Little Village (South Lawndale), Pilsen (Lower West Side), Brighton Park, Archer Heights, Gage Park, Chicago Lawn, and the suburb of Cicero.\\n\\nAll services are offered regardless of ability to pay, and 32% percent of patients’ fees are determined using a sliding fee scale, making care available to all. The payor mix of our patients demonstrates the need in the community:\\n\\n32 percent are uninsured\\n55 percent are covered by Medicaid\\n 3  percent by Medicare\\nOnly 10 percent have private insurance\\nMore than 50 percent of our Board of Directors receive their own healthcare at Esperanza.","postal_code":"60608-2486","avatar_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/3/1/2/3127de70-6d54-4956-9d16-7120c72f962d/5ea81567-c4fc-474c-9bfc-d07a907b2111/img-1450389757488.png_sz","header_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/3/1/2/3127de70-6d54-4956-9d16-7120c72f962d/da26515f-155a-421b-99b2-898672eb0282/img-1475270608160.jpg_sz"},

GYO creates a career pathway for individuals who have a passion for teaching, but don’t have the means or opportunity to realize that passion.  At the same time that GYO is helping to move low income community members out of poverty and into a stable profession that also allows them to give back to their community, it is also producing the most diverse teachers of any training program in the state for our highest needs schools and highest need students.  \\nGYO grew out of the work of Chicago organizing groups working in low-income neighborhoods to improve schools. Just like today, their schools were facing massive teacher turnover, a widening cultural mismatch between students and teachers and an achievement gap among low-income students. \\nThough it started in Chicago, Grow Your Own developed into a state-wide program. Currently there are 11 consortia across Illinois.  At its inception, the Chicago groups created a stand-alone non-profit, Grow Your Own Illinois, to run the program and advocate on its behalf. Earlier this year, GYO was designated a “Bright Spot in Hispanic Education” by the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics for its work providing educational opportunities for Latino students.  GYO was also named in the recent Albert Shanker Institute report “The State of Teacher Diversity in American Education” as one of eight programs across the country successfully tackling the diversity gap between teachers and students in public schools. \\nThe majority of GYO candidates are low-income working mothers. 74% of GYO candidates are women, 71% have dependents and 86% work either full or part-time. They are returning to school after a long hiatus or entering a higher education classroom for the first time. For many, the dream of returning to, or starting college, is elusive.

GYO creates a career pathway for individuals who have a passion for teaching, but don’t have the means or opportunity to realize that passion.  At the same time that GYO is helping to move low income community members out of poverty and into a stable profession that also allows them to give back to their community, it is also producing the most diverse teachers of any training program in the state for our highest needs schools and highest need students.  \\nGYO grew out of the work of Chicago organizing groups working in low-income neighborhoods to improve schools. Just like today, their schools were facing massive teacher turnover, a widening cultural mismatch between students and teachers and an achievement gap among low-income students. \\nThough it started in Chicago, Grow Your Own developed into a state-wide program. Currently there are 11 consortia across Illinois.  At its inception, the Chicago groups created a stand-alone non-profit, Grow Your Own Illinois, to run the program and advocate on its behalf. Earlier this year, GYO was designated a “Bright Spot in Hispanic Education” by the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics for its work providing educational opportunities for Latino students.  GYO was also named in the recent Albert Shanker Institute report “The State of Teacher Diversity in American Education” as one of eight programs across the country successfully tackling the diversity gap between teachers and students in public schools. \\nThe majority of GYO candidates are low-income working mothers. 74% of GYO candidates are women, 71% have dependents and 86% work either full or part-time. They are returning to school after a long hiatus or entering a higher education classroom for the first time. For many, the dream of returning to, or starting college, is elusive. Through forgivable loans for tuition and intensive wrap-around services, like financial assistance for child care, transportation and tutoring, the barriers that prevent many working women from returning to school are lifted.  \\nOnce in the classroom, GYO teachers inspire and motivate their students. They are able to quickly engage students and positively impact their achievement.  GYO teachers connect with students and their parents in a meaningful way that contributes to student engagement.

A Mentor Angel is a cancer survivor or caregiver who is the same age, same gender, and most importantly who has faced the same type of cancer.\\n\\nOur service is absolutely free and helps anyone touched by any type of cancer, at any cancer stage level, at any age, living anywhere in the world.\\n\\nThese one-on-one relationships give a cancer fighter or caregiver the chance to ask personal questions and get support from someone who has been there before. Mentor Angels can lend support and empathy and help cancer fighters and caregivers navigate the system, determine their options and create their own support systems. Frequently, caregivers experience feelings similar to those of the person facing cancer. Mentor Angels can relate while being sensitive to the experience and situation.","postal_code":"60606-1867","avatar_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/7/b/d/7bdbbe74-1ba7-410e-9de3-0cb7e81a53bb/dbac4011-21c0-498f-8cb8-d5608f852424/img-1452529116179.png_sz","header_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/7/b/d/7bdbbe74-1ba7-410e-9de3-0cb7e81a53bb/447ac45e-baca-4a5b-b1f5-5cb22c3ecfff/img-1452529152180.jpg_sz"},

Through individual meetings and group discussions new recruits are encouraged to assess their current situation and identify skills and a knowledge base needed to achieve the goals they have targeted.  Young people are actively involved in all operations of KOB from program planning and design to actual implementation.   \\n\\nThe “at-risk” youth are involved in Health Workshops, Cultural Events, Educational Tutoring and celebrations in their honor for achievements and participation.

One code that is paramount is that we never leave a soldier, seaman, airman, or marine behind. This principle should transcend the military and should be a part of our national fabric as Americans. We should not allow individuals to slip through the cracks, especially if they are bettering themselves as citizens and soldiers by attaining higher education so that they may bring their expertise to the military and civilian workplace. It is well understood that veterans of wars are highly vulnerable to a number of social and mental ills that affect them at higher rates than average Americans. It is also well known that veterans make up a disproportionate amount of our homeless population.

Though ze worked in a variety of roles with LGBTQ youth, with the intent of meeting a broad range of needs, the common denominator with many of these young folks was the need for safe, affirming housing in which to become stabilized, access resources and to heal and grow from lives often fraught with institutional and interpersonal violence. After working within institutions that were not always responsive to young people’s needs, either due to limitations imposed by funding or structure, PFC’s founder set out to create a program design that utilized the rich skills, talent, dedication and financial resources from within the LGBTQ community, rather than looking outward to institutions or the government for support. The goal was - and continues to be - to remain autonomous in organizational decision-making, as to be accountable and responsive to changing, expressed needs of participants. \\n\\nThe founding leadership team was incepted in the fall of 2012, and after much discussion of strategies and values, the organization publicly launched in April 2013, with a crowd-funding campaign to raise the funds to pay for 501(c)3 filing. The community gave over $8,000 more than what was requested, which indicated a broad interest in this issue and pointed to the moment being right to push the work forward. Project Fierce Chicago acquired 501(c)3 status in the summer of 2013, and has been evolving ever since.","postal_code":"60637-1676","avatar_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/b/c/0/bc057240-01df-4078-9e37-72a9dcc4a8ea/7702ad0b-9b7e-45ce-acec-a7d10e76dc34/logo.jpg.png_sz","header_image_url":"https://d24e126z36k4ma.cloudfront.net/userdata/3/e/e/3ee394e9-875d-4ee5-b805-21af7697a117/8df21128-6b44-4f2c-abe3-f9c0b1c5528d/11148632_1059141430803897_130355144494816356_n.jpg_sz"},

We serve as trusted allies for these children by accompanying them through court proceedings, advocating for their best interests, and standing for the creation of a dedicated juvenile immigrant justice system that ensures the safety and well-being of every child.\\n\\nPosition Statement: Every young immigrant deserves to be safe. Young children who flee violence, abuse and poverty need an advocate, not an adversary. The Young Center is their champion in an immigration system that is not designed to treat children as children.
